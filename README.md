# Pac-Men
developed pacman app using Javascript 

Developed a PacMen app using JavaScript. Created 4 PacMan images 2 facing right one with an open mouth one with a closed mouth. Then 2 facing left one with an open mouth one with a closed mouth. Set them on timeout functions so it appears as if the PacMan is moving back and forth across the screen like it does in the game

a button should appear the more you click it the more pacman characters appear jumping on the screen

load the code and a button should appear the more you click it the more pacman characters appear jumping on the screen

in the future I hope an assortment of characters that can jump across the screen as the button is clicked.  Not just pacman
